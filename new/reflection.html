    <h1>CHECKED Reflection on CMA CGM</h1>
    
    <p>
        Studying CMA CGM as part of our cloud computing course gave me a powerful 
        look into how digital technologies are transforming traditional industries. 
        Before this class, I didn’t realize how deeply companies like CMA CGM depend 
        on cloud infrastructure to operate efficiently. As a global leader in shipping 
        and logistics, CMA CGM has to manage thousands of containers and ships across 
        countless routes, and cloud computing plays a vital role in making all of that 
        possible. This exploration helped me connect the technical concepts we’ve 
        learned in class to their real-world applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the topics I found most interesting was how data is collected from ships 
        in real time. Each vessel generates massive amounts of data, from engine performance 
        to fuel usage and environmental conditions. This data is transmitted to the cloud, 
        where it can be analyzed to improve efficiency, predict maintenance needs, and 
        reduce carbon emissions. The idea that a shipping company can remotely monitor 
        and optimize its fleet using data analytics really impressed me. It showed me 
        how valuable real-time data is in making smarter decisions on a global scale.
    </p>

    <p>
        What really captured my attention was the use of cloud services to handle this 
        flood of information. CMA CGM relies on cloud platforms not only to store and 
        process data, but also to integrate it into dashboards and tools that help managers 
        and engineers take action quickly. The scalability and flexibility of cloud computing 
        are crucial here, since the volume of data can vary constantly depending on 
        shipping traffic and global events. Seeing cloud technology used this way gave 
        me a much deeper understanding of the concepts we’ve covered in class, like 
        virtualization, scalability, and data redundancy.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also appreciated the company’s commitment to sustainability and innovation. 
        CMA CGM is investing in solutions like smart routing systems and energy-efficient 
        engines, which are made possible through data-driven insights. Knowing that the 
        same technologies we study—like cloud-based AI models and IoT systems—are helping 
        to reduce fuel consumption and environmental impact made me realize the positive 
        potential of this field. It’s not just about speed or profits; it’s also about 
        making better choices for the future.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, learning about CMA CGM has deepened my interest in cloud computing and 
        how it’s used in large-scale operations. It was exciting to discover how companies 
        are leveraging cloud-based tools to solve real-world problems, especially in areas 
        like global logistics where precision and timing are everything. This project gave 
        me a new perspective on the power of data and the importance of technical infrastructure. 
        It also made me consider pursuing a future in cloud systems architecture or data engineering, 
        where I could work on similar challenges and innovations.
